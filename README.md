# Sounders Matchday Experience
## A Storymap Project

### About the Project
As sports teams and front offices work to immerse consumers in the fan experience in all apsects of fan interaction, identifying simple changes to materials can bring added layer of depth to the immersion into the fan experience. Teams that are located in areas where fans have high spending power allows for an opportunity to sell the ideal fan 'experience' to get maximum profit out of each ticket. This storymap was designed as an example of the potential uses of storymaps as a promotional tool for the fan experience, through total immersion into the fan culture that transcends much more than just the match that the ticketholders have paid for. Although this map makes use of many services not associated with the team, it is just an example of the way this tool could be used. Storymaps such as this one could be used in all aspects of fan interaction, including marketing, wayfinding, social media, and even gameday informational programs.
